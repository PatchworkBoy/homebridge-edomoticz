The plugin will internally extract the username and password, base64 encode it and send it as a http authorization header whenever it talks to your Domoticz server.\n\n### SSL\nSet \"ssl\":1 in config.json to turn on SSL (ie: server connects with https:// rather than http://). You will need to specify your SSL port - usually \"port\":\"443\" by default.\n\n### Issues pairing to Homebridge when you have a lot of Domoticz sensors...\nIf you have more than 100 devices in Domoticz, you need to limit the number of devices exposed to HomeKit (HomeKit only supports 100 Accessories on a single bridge - whilst we could combine multiple sensors into a single homekit accessory within the plugin, the possible combinations out there are endless, so we won't).\n\nTherefore, to reduce the number of devices exposed from Domoticz, create a roomplan within Domoticz via Setup > More Options > Plans > roomplan. Add only the devices you wish to be exposed to HomeKit to this new roomplan within Domoticz, and then get it's roomidx number. Set \"roomid\" in your config.json file to this room number.\n\n### Is my <<some accessory>> supported??\nSee [Domoticz API Reference](https://www.domoticz.com/wiki/Domoticz_API/JSON_URL's#Retrieve_status_of_specific_device) - query your device as per the instructions there, and if your device’s SwitchTypeVal isn't in the 'Supports:' list or Type/SubType aren’t in the ’Provides:' list above then it'll just appear as an On/Off switch. [Open a new issue](https://github.com/PatchworkBoy/homebridge-eDomoticz/issues/new) including the output from the json api and I’ll get look into supporting that particular device more fully!\n\n### What does the Override slider represent on the EvoHome Thermostat?\nOverride-Until time in minutes from the current time. Allows setting an override-until time upto 8 hours in the future. Setting this slider to 0 will set the heating mode to Auto. Setting it to 481 will set the override as a PermanentOverride.\n\n### Logging\nComplies with Homebridge's native logging & debugging methodology - see https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge/wiki/Basic-Trouble-Shooting\n",
